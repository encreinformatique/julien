            I have been working as a freelance programmer full-stack since 2018. And before that, I was a
            <strong>start-up developer</strong>, the kind of person you can rely on to <strong>move your systems forward</strong>
            without the need of supervision.<br>
            I’ve always had a passion for learning quite a lot of stuff and understand how it works.
            Having a logical side helped a lot. Since I discovered programming before the University, it has been a
            one way street.

            Having landed on this page, you probably are in need of a solution for a web project. This is perfect
            because this is exactly what I do for a living.
